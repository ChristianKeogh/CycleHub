# CycleHub

CycleHub is monitor of a bike-sharing system designed to promote sustainable urban mobility, reduce traffic congestion, and provide convenient transportation options for city dwellers. Similar to Dublin Bike websites, CycleHub aims to provide a network of strategically located bike stations throughout the city where users can easily rent and return bicycles for short trips.

Myself and two classmates made this website to create a journey planner for users of Dublin Bikes. The stack used is as following:

HTML, CSS, JS, Flask, AWS, SQLalchemy, a Linear Regression predictive model, OpenWeather API, and Google Maps API.

The integration of Google Maps and OpenWeather allowed the website to create a joruney layout that brings the user to the closest station, on a cycle path through Dublin, to the station that is closest to their destination, and finally to their final destination via a walking route.

The journey planner takes an input of day and time and gives a prediction based on future weather how busy different stations will be.

Below is some of the output of the data modelling we leveraged.
